# NNUEGomoku
An AI for Gomoku, implementing the NNUE architecture.

In order to start the game, run the `main.py` and choose which agent to play to black coloured stones and which agent to play the white coloured stones.

There are multiple agents to chose from. If you want to play yourself against an agent, choose `human`.

The NNUE model is implemented in `nnue.py`, the classic model in `classical_nn.py` with the Minimax AI in `agent_minimax.py`.
